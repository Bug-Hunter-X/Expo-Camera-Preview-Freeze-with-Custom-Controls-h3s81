This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom camera controls.  The issue is that on certain devices or under specific conditions, the camera preview might freeze or become unresponsive.  This isn't immediately apparent in basic camera examples but surfaces when attempting to manage manual focus, zoom, or other advanced settings.  The camera preview will appear normal initially but eventually hangs, requiring a full app restart.
